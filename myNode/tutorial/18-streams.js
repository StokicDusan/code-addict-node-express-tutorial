//Streams - Writable, Readable, Duplex, Transform

// Just like with events, many built in modules in node 
// implement streaming interface

// Streams extend event emiters class !!

// Read stream option helps with files that are to big to read
// or if we want the conserve memory because we might not need 
// everything from that, lets say, text file
